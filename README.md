<h1>Backtracking Solvers</h1>
<h2>This repository contains three backtracking solver programs implemented in Python.</h2>

<h3>Sudoku Backtracking Solver</h3>
The Sudoku Backtracking Solver is a Python program that solves Sudoku puzzles using a backtracking algorithm. It takes an incomplete Sudoku puzzle as input and returns the solved puzzle.

<h3>Binox Backtracking Solver</h3>
The Binox Backtracking Solver is a Python program that solves Binox puzzles using a backtracking algorithm. Binox is a logic puzzle game where players fill a grid with zeros and ones according to specific rules.

<h3>Maze Solver</h3>
The Maze Solver is a Python program that finds the shortest path through a maze using a backtracking algorithm. Given a maze with a start and end point, the program determines the shortest path from the start to the end.

<h2>Each solver is implemented using the backtracking algorithm, which explores all possible solutions recursively and efficiently finds the correct solution.</h2>
